# About me

I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at [Monash University, Australia](https://www.monash.edu/). My PhD research focuses on the problem of forecasting large collections of time series. I am working with Professor [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/) and Professor [George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos). 

I enjoy solving general data science problems from three different angles: theoretical, computational, applied. In this website you will find some of my work and interests on statistics and data analysis. I am also interested in R programming language.
