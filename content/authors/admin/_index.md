I am a Lecturer in the Department of Statistics, Faculty of Applied Sciences at the [University of Sri Jayewardenepura](http://science.sjp.ac.lk/). I received my PhD in Statistics from [Monash University, Australia](https://www.monash.edu/) under the research title "Computationally efficient forecasting methods for large-scale real-time applications". My thesis advisors were Professor [Rob J Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/) and Professor [George Athanasopoulos](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/george-athanasopoulos). 

I enjoy solving general data science problems from three different angles: theoretical, computational, applied. In this website you will find some of my work and interests on statistics and data analysis. I am also interested in R programming language.

[Priyanga Dilini Talagala](https://prital.netlify.com/)  PhD in Statistics, Monash University, Australia is my sister.
