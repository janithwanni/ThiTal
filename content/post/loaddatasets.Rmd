## Spotting the problem

First, I create a small dataset for the demonstration. The following dataset represents the Happiness index for five countries.

```{r, comment=NA}
happy <- data.frame(
  country = c("Finland", "Norway", "Denmark", "Iceland", "Netherlands"),
  score = c(7.76, 7.60, 7.55, 7.49, 7.48))

happy
```

Name save the dataset as shown below.

```r
save(happy, file="happyindex.rda")

```

Let's load the dataset with,

```r
load("happyindex.rda")
```

```r
happyindex
```

The following error message pops up,

> Error: object 'happyindex' not found

## Tackling the problem

```r
loadHappy <- load("happyindex.rda")
happyDataloaded <- get(loadHappy)
happyDataloaded
```
