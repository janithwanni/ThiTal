Sometimes we need to view all the functions that are built into an R package.
This is done in the same way you would list variables in your workspace, using the `ls` function. Note that the package must be loaded before you run the `ls` command.

**Usage:** Getting a list of functions inside the `dplyr` package

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
ls("package:dplyr")
```
