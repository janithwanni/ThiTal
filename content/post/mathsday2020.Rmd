summary: "Nature is my biggest inspiration for my love and passion for mathematics."
---

Nature is my biggest inspiration for my love and passion for mathematics. It is amazing to see how these leaves follow geometry to ensure the surface is optimized for the absorption of sunlight. Indeed, nature is a good Mathematician. All its presentations are well calculated and designed. I see a great artist or a designer inside every Mathematician. Maths will teach you how to hold your brush, how to mix your paints and how to manage your tools for a great design. 

Enjoy the spirit of Mathematics!
