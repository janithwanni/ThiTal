### To view list of data sets available in a particular package or a group of packages.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}
vcdExtra::datasets(c("ggplot2", "forecast"))
```


### To view data sets in package `datasets`. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, comment=NA}

```r
Data sets in package ‘alr4’:

...


Data sets in package ‘asbio’:
