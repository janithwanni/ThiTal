Peeking inside FFORMS: Feature-based FORecast Model Selection Thiyanga S. Talagala$^1$, Rob J. Hyndman$^1$, George Athanasopoulos$^1$

Features of time series are useful in identifying suitable forecast models. Talagala, Hyndman &amp;amp; Athanasopoulos (2018) proposed a classification framework, called FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection), which selects forecast models based on features calculated from the time series. The FFORMS framework builds a mapping that relates the features of a time series to the “best” forecast model using the random forest algorithm.</description>

      <description>Abstract
This work presents three feature-based algorithms for large-scale time series forecasting. The algorithms are developed based on meta-learning approach. In our first algorithm we use a random forest algorithm to identify the best forecasting model. We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection). In the second algorithm, FFORMA (Feature-based FORecast Model Averaging), we use gradient boosting to obtain the weights for forecast combinations. The third algorithm use efficient Bayesian multivariate surface regression approach to estimate forecast error for each method, and then using the minimum predicted error to select a forecasting model or to choose individual models for forecast combinations.</description>

      <description>Abstract
Many applications require a large number of time series to be forecast. Providing better forecasts for these time series is important in decision and policy making. However, large scale time series data present numerous challenges in modelling and implementation due to the high dimensionality. It is unlikely that a single method will consistently provides better forecasts across all time series. On the other hand, selecting individual forecast models when the number of series is very large can be extremely challenging.</description>

      <description>Abstract
A crucial task in time series forecasting is the identification of the most suitable forecasting method. We present a general framework for forecast model selection using meta-learning. A Random Forest is used to predict the best forecasting method using only time series features. The proposed framework has been evaluated using time series from the M1 and M3 competitions, and is shown to yield accurate forecasts comparable to several benchmarks and other commonly used automated approaches of time series forecasting.</description>

      <description>Abstract
The seer package provides a novel framework for forecast model selection using time series features. We call this framework FFORMS (Feature-based FORecast Model Selection). The underlying approach involves computing a vector of features from the time series which are then used to select the forecasting model. The model selection process is carried out using a classification algorithm &amp;ndash; we use the time series features as inputs, and the best forecasting algorithm as the output.</description>
